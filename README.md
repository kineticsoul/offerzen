Please view this as an answer to the questions asked at the bottom of the assessment but also as a guide to help get it up an running on your local machine.\
The instructions to run it will be at the bottom of this file.

## How long did this assignment take you and where did you spend your time?

This assignment took me about 6 to 7 hours of development time.

Where I mostly spent my time was on the assets - logo, fonts etc.

Also on the boilerplate of adding **Redux** and state management to the app.

Adding state management was overkill but I used it as a future proofing way or creating the app. At anytime should other pages or more things need to be added, they can leverage the already existing structure.

## What would you do differently or improve in your solution?

I did not use a table to render the main content that is something I would change if needed.\
The contents is also not a component so I would definitely also try make it a standalone component.

## Do you have any feedback on this assignment? For example: What did you enjoy? What could be better? Which aspects were unclear?

The logo and fonts used in the designs were hard to find, I think it would have been nice to have them be provided/exported for the image.

The fonts on the other hand are not free, so I had to settle for a different close lookign font, I used **Montserrat**, **Lato** would also have worked I think.

I also was not familiar with **Figma** and it took me a while just to get the correct colors on the different elements

I enjoyed the fact that I created everything from scratch for all the visual components.

I also approached it in a manner of separating as much of my code as possible. Actions in actions, components etc. I enjoyed having to figure out how to handle the state with as little effort as possible between all the files.

Apart from that, all was clear and made sense.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

Install all dependencies and plugins for the app to run as intended.

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
